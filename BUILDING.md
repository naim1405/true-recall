2. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Update README.md (version number at bottom)
4. Commit changes
5. Tag release: `git tag v1.x`
6. Build and test
7. Create GitHub release
8. Upload binaries

Recommendation: **Start with ZIP**, add installer later if needed.

---

## Sharing the Binary

Safe to share via:
- GitHub Releases
- Personal website
- Direct download link
- Cloud storage (OneDrive, Dropbox)

**Security note:** Users will see SmartScreen warning for unsigned binaries. This is normal for new applications.

---

## Final Notes
